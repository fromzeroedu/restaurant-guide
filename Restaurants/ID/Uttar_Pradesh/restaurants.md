Haveli Restaurant
It's a budget friendly vegetarian restaurant. The taste of food is good. Many varieties of snacks are also available over here. Chilly potato, chilly paneer, cheese cigar are my favourite snacks. This is also among my Favourite Restaurants. Very Tasty Vegetarian Food. I understand it serves only vegetarian food. Value for Money. Attentive Staff. The only thing which I don't like is it's cramped space.
